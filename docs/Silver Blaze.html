<h1>Silver Blaze</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,” said Holmes, as we</p>
<p>sat down together to our breakfast one morning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Go! Where to?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“To Dartmoor; to King’s Pyland.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not</p>
<p>already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the</p>
<p>one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of</p>
<p>England. For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room</p>
<p>with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and</p>
<p>recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and</p>
<p>absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions</p>
<p>of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be</p>
<p>glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he</p>
<p>was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was</p>
<p>brooding. There was but one problem before the public which could</p>
<p>challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular</p>
<p>disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic</p>
<p>murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced his</p>
<p>intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only</p>
<p>what I had both expected and hoped for.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in</p>
<p>the way,” said I.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My dear Watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by</p>
<p>coming. And I think that your time will not be misspent, for</p>
<p>there are points about the case which promise to make it an</p>
<p>absolutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to catch our</p>
<p>train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon</p>
<p>our journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your very</p>
<p>excellent field-glass.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the</p>
<p>corner of a first-class carriage flying along en route for</p>
<p>Exeter, while Sherlock Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed</p>
<p>in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle</p>
<p>of fresh papers which he had procured at Paddington. We had left</p>
<p>Reading far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under</p>
<p>the seat, and offered me his cigar-case.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We are going well,” said he, looking out the window and glancing</p>
<p>at his watch. “Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half</p>
<p>miles an hour.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,” said I.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Nor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty</p>
<p>yards apart, and the calculation is a simple one. I presume that</p>
<p>you have looked into this matter of the murder of John Straker</p>
<p>and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have seen what the _Telegraph_ and the _Chronicle_ have to</p>
<p>say.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be</p>
<p>used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of</p>
<p>fresh evidence. The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and</p>
<p>of such personal importance to so many people, that we are</p>
<p>suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis.</p>
<p>The difficulty is to detach the framework of fact—of absolute</p>
<p>undeniable fact—from the embellishments of theorists and</p>
<p>reporters. Then, having established ourselves upon this sound</p>
<p>basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn and</p>
<p>what are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both Colonel Ross,</p>
<p>the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is</p>
<p>looking after the case, inviting my co-operation.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Tuesday evening!” I exclaimed. “And this is Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Why didn’t you go down yesterday?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Because I made a blunder, my dear Watson—which is, I am afraid,</p>
<p>a more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew</p>
<p>me through your memoirs. The fact is that I could not believe it</p>
<p>possible that the most remarkable horse in England could long</p>
<p>remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as</p>
<p>the north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour yesterday I expected to</p>
<p>hear that he had been found, and that his abductor was the</p>
<p>murderer of John Straker. When, however, another morning had</p>
<p>come, and I found that beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy Simpson</p>
<p>nothing had been done, I felt that it was time for me to take</p>
<p>action. Yet in some ways I feel that yesterday has not been</p>
<p>wasted.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You have formed a theory, then?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“At least I have got a grip of the essential facts of the case. I</p>
<p>shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much</p>
<p>as stating it to another person, and I can hardly expect your</p>
<p>co-operation if I do not show you the position from which we</p>
<p>start.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while</p>
<p>Holmes, leaning forward, with his long, thin forefinger checking</p>
<p>off the points upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch</p>
<p>of the events which had led to our journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Silver Blaze,” said he, “is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as</p>
<p>brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth</p>
<p>year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to</p>
<p>Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. Up to the time of the</p>
<p>catastrophe he was the first favourite for the Wessex Cup, the</p>
<p>betting being three to one on him. He has always, however, been a</p>
<p>prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet</p>
<p>disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of</p>
<p>money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that</p>
<p>there were many people who had the strongest interest in</p>
<p>preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag</p>
<p>next Tuesday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The fact was, of course, appreciated at King’s Pyland, where the</p>
<p>Colonel’s training-stable is situated. Every precaution was taken</p>
<p>to guard the favourite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired</p>
<p>jockey who rode in Colonel Ross’s colours before he became too</p>
<p>heavy for the weighing-chair. He has served the Colonel for five</p>
<p>years as jockey and for seven as trainer, and has always shown</p>
<p>himself to be a zealous and honest servant. Under him were three</p>
<p>lads; for the establishment was a small one, containing only four</p>
<p>horses in all. One of these lads sat up each night in the stable,</p>
<p>while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent</p>
<p>characters. John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small</p>
<p>villa about two hundred yards from the stables. He has no</p>
<p>children, keeps one maid-servant, and is comfortably off. The</p>
<p>country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north</p>
<p>there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a</p>
<p>Tavistock contractor for the use of invalids and others who may</p>
<p>wish to enjoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two</p>
<p>miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles</p>
<p>distant, is the larger training establishment of Mapleton, which</p>
<p>belongs to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In</p>
<p>every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness,</p>
<p>inhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was the general</p>
<p>situation last Monday night when the catastrophe occurred.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as</p>
<p>usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o’clock. Two of the</p>
<p>lads walked up to the trainer’s house, where they had supper in</p>
<p>the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. At a</p>
<p>few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to</p>
<p>the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried</p>
<p>mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the</p>
<p>stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink</p>
<p>nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very</p>
<p>dark and the path ran across the open moor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man</p>
<p>appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he</p>
<p>stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she</p>
<p>saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a</p>
<p>grey suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and</p>
<p>carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed,</p>
<p>however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness</p>
<p>of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty</p>
<p>than under it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Can you tell me where I am?’ he asked. ‘I had almost made up my</p>
<p>mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘You are close to the King’s Pyland training-stables,’ said she.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!’ he cried. ‘I understand</p>
<p>that a stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is</p>
<p>his supper which you are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you</p>
<p>would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would</p>
<p>you?’ He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his</p>
<p>waistcoat pocket. ‘See that the boy has this to-night, and you</p>
<p>shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“She was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran</p>
<p>past him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand</p>
<p>the meals. It was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the</p>
<p>small table inside. She had begun to tell him of what had</p>
<p>happened, when the stranger came up again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Good-evening,’ said he, looking through the window. ‘I wanted</p>
<p>to have a word with you.’ The girl has sworn that as he spoke she</p>
<p>noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his</p>
<p>closed hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘What business have you here?’ asked the lad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘It’s business that may put something into your pocket,’ said</p>
<p>the other. ‘You’ve two horses in for the Wessex Cup—Silver Blaze</p>
<p>and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip and you won’t be a</p>
<p>loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the</p>
<p>other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have</p>
<p>put their money on him?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘So, you’re one of those damned touts!’ cried the lad. ‘I’ll</p>
<p>show you how we serve them in King’s Pyland.’ He sprang up and</p>
<p>rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. The girl fled away</p>
<p>to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the</p>
<p>stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however,</p>
<p>when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he</p>
<p>ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“One moment,” I asked. “Did the stable-boy, when he ran out with</p>
<p>the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Excellent, Watson, excellent!” murmured my companion. “The</p>
<p>importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a</p>
<p>special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The</p>
<p>boy locked the door before he left it. The window, I may add, was</p>
<p>not large enough for a man to get through.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent</p>
<p>a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker</p>
<p>was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to</p>
<p>have quite realized its true significance. It left him, however,</p>
<p>vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker, waking at one in the morning,</p>
<p>found that he was dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said</p>
<p>that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the</p>
<p>horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see</p>
<p>that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could</p>
<p>hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her</p>
<p>entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her</p>
<p>husband had not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called</p>
<p>the maid, and set off for the stables. The door was open; inside,</p>
<p>huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of</p>
<p>absolute stupor, the favourite’s stall was empty, and there were</p>
<p>no signs of his trainer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the</p>
<p>harness-room were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during</p>
<p>the night, for they are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously</p>
<p>under the influence of some powerful drug, and as no sense could</p>
<p>be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads</p>
<p>and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. They still</p>
<p>had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the</p>
<p>horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the</p>
<p>house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, they</p>
<p>not only could see no signs of the missing favourite, but they</p>
<p>perceived something which warned them that they were in the</p>
<p>presence of a tragedy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“About a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker’s</p>
<p>overcoat was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there</p>
<p>was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of</p>
<p>this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head</p>
<p>had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and</p>
<p>he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut,</p>
<p>inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear,</p>
<p>however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his</p>
<p>assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which</p>
<p>was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he</p>
<p>clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognised by the</p>
<p>maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger</p>
<p>who had visited the stables.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive</p>
<p>as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that</p>
<p>the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his</p>
<p>curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud</p>
<p>which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been</p>
<p>there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has</p>
<p>disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and</p>
<p>all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of</p>
<p>him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his</p>
<p>supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of</p>
<p>powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the same</p>
<p>dish on the same night without any ill effect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise,</p>
<p>and stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what</p>
<p>the police have done in the matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an</p>
<p>extremely competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination</p>
<p>he might rise to great heights in his profession. On his arrival</p>
<p>he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion</p>
<p>naturally rested. There was little difficulty in finding him, for</p>
<p>he inhabited one of those villas which I have mentioned. His</p>
<p>name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent</p>
<p>birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf,</p>
<p>and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making</p>
<p>in the sporting clubs of London. An examination of his</p>
<p>betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand</p>
<p>pounds had been registered by him against the favourite.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come</p>
<p>down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about</p>
<p>the King’s Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second</p>
<p>favourite, which was in charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton</p>
<p>stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as</p>
<p>described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no</p>
<p>sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand</p>
<p>information. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very</p>
<p>pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the</p>
<p>hand of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had</p>
<p>been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which</p>
<p>was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as</p>
<p>might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to</p>
<p>which the trainer had succumbed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the</p>
<p>state of Straker’s knife would show that one at least of his</p>
<p>assailants must bear his mark upon him. There you have it all in</p>
<p>a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be</p>
<p>infinitely obliged to you.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which</p>
<p>Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though</p>
<p>most of the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently</p>
<p>appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection to</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Is it not possible,” I suggested, “that the incised wound upon</p>
<p>Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive</p>
<p>struggles which follow any brain injury?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It is more than possible; it is probable,” said Holmes. “In that</p>
<p>case one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And yet,” said I, “even now I fail to understand what the theory</p>
<p>of the police can be.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave</p>
<p>objections to it,” returned my companion. “The police imagine, I</p>
<p>take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and</p>
<p>having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable</p>
<p>door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of</p>
<p>kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson</p>
<p>must have put this on. Then, having left the door open behind</p>
<p>him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was</p>
<p>either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued.</p>
<p>Simpson beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick</p>
<p>without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker</p>
<p>used in self-defence, and then the thief either led the horse on</p>
<p>to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during</p>
<p>the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the</p>
<p>case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all</p>
<p>other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall</p>
<p>very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and</p>
<p>until then I cannot really see how we can get much further than</p>
<p>our present position.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock,</p>
<p>which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge</p>
<p>circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the</p>
<p>station—the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard</p>
<p>and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small,</p>
<p>alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters,</p>
<p>with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was</p>
<p>Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector</p>
<p>Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English</p>
<p>detective service.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,” said the</p>
<p>Colonel. “The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be</p>
<p>suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to</p>
<p>avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Have there been any fresh developments?” asked Holmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,” said</p>
<p>the Inspector. “We have an open carriage outside, and as you</p>
<p>would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we</p>
<p>might talk it over as we drive.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and</p>
<p>were rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector</p>
<p>Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks,</p>
<p>while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection.</p>
<p>Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted</p>
<p>over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of</p>
<p>the two detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was</p>
<p>almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,” he</p>
<p>remarked, “and I believe myself that he is our man. At the same</p>
<p>time I recognise that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and</p>
<p>that some new development may upset it.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“How about Straker’s knife?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in</p>
<p>his fall.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down.</p>
<p>If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The</p>
<p>evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great</p>
<p>interest in the disappearance of the favourite. He lies under</p>
<p>suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly</p>
<p>out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat</p>
<p>was found in the dead man’s hand. I really think we have enough</p>
<p>to go before a jury.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holmes shook his head. “A clever counsel would tear it all to</p>
<p>rags,” said he. “Why should he take the horse out of the stable?</p>
<p>If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there? Has a</p>
<p>duplicate key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him</p>
<p>the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the</p>
<p>district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own</p>
<p>explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to</p>
<p>the stable-boy?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his</p>
<p>purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they</p>
<p>seem. He is not a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged</p>
<p>at Tavistock in the summer. The opium was probably brought from</p>
<p>London. The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away.</p>
<p>The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines</p>
<p>upon the moor.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What does he say about the cravat?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost</p>
<p>it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may</p>
<p>account for his leading the horse from the stable.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holmes pricked up his ears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped</p>
<p>on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took</p>
<p>place. On Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was</p>
<p>some understanding between Simpson and these gypsies, might he</p>
<p>not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken,</p>
<p>and may they not have him now?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It is certainly possible.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also</p>
<p>examined every stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a</p>
<p>radius of ten miles.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“There is another training-stable quite close, I understand?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect.</p>
<p>As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had</p>
<p>an interest in the disappearance of the favourite. Silas Brown,</p>
<p>the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and</p>
<p>he was no friend to poor Straker. We have, however, examined the</p>
<p>stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of</p>
<p>the Mapleton stables?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Nothing at all.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased.</p>
<p>A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little</p>
<p>red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road.</p>
<p>Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long grey-tiled</p>
<p>out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the</p>
<p>moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to</p>
<p>the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a</p>
<p>cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton</p>
<p>stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who</p>
<p>continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front</p>
<p>of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I</p>
<p>touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and</p>
<p>stepped out of the carriage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Excuse me,” said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at</p>
<p>him in some surprise. “I was day-dreaming.” There was a gleam in</p>
<p>his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which</p>
<p>convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a</p>
<p>clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the</p>
<p>crime, Mr. Holmes?” said Gregory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into</p>
<p>one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I</p>
<p>presume?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-morrow.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“He has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have always found him an excellent servant.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his</p>
<p>pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would</p>
<p>care to see them.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I should be very glad.” We all filed into the front room and sat</p>
<p>round the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin</p>
<p>box and laid a small heap of things before us. There was a box of</p>
<p>vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a</p>
<p>pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a</p>
<p>silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an</p>
<p>aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife</p>
<p>with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked Weiss & Co.,</p>
<p>London.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“This is a very singular knife,” said Holmes, lifting it up and</p>
<p>examining it minutely. “I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it,</p>
<p>that it is the one which was found in the dead man’s grasp.</p>
<p>Watson, this knife is surely in your line?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It is what we call a cataract knife,” said I.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate</p>
<p>work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough</p>
<p>expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his</p>
<p>body,” said the Inspector. “His wife tells us that the knife had</p>
<p>lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he</p>
<p>left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he</p>
<p>could lay his hands on at the moment.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Very possible. How about these papers?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. One of them</p>
<p>is a letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a</p>
<p>milliner’s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by</p>
<p>Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. Mrs.</p>
<p>Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband’s</p>
<p>and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Madam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,” remarked</p>
<p>Holmes, glancing down the account. “Twenty-two guineas is rather</p>
<p>heavy for a single costume. However there appears to be nothing</p>
<p>more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting</p>
<p>in the passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the</p>
<p>Inspector’s sleeve. Her face was haggard and thin and eager,</p>
<p>stamped with the print of a recent horror.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Have you got them? Have you found them?” she panted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“No, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has come from London to</p>
<p>help us, and we shall do all that is possible.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Surely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-party some little time</p>
<p>ago, Mrs. Straker?” said Holmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“No, sir; you are mistaken.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Dear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. You wore a costume of</p>
<p>dove-coloured silk with ostrich-feather trimming.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I never had such a dress, sir,” answered the lady.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Ah, that quite settles it,” said Holmes. And with an apology he</p>
<p>followed the Inspector outside. A short walk across the moor took</p>
<p>us to the hollow in which the body had been found. At the brink</p>
<p>of it was the furze-bush upon which the coat had been hung.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“There was no wind that night, I understand,” said Holmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“None; but very heavy rain.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“In that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze-bush,</p>
<p>but placed there.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, it was laid across the bush.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You fill me with interest, I perceive that the ground has been</p>
<p>trampled up a good deal. No doubt many feet have been here since</p>
<p>Monday night.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have</p>
<p>all stood upon that.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Excellent.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of</p>
<p>Fitzroy Simpson’s shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!” Holmes took the bag,</p>
<p>and, descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a</p>
<p>more central position. Then stretching himself upon his face and</p>
<p>leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a careful study of the</p>
<p>trampled mud in front of him. “Hullo!” said he, suddenly. “What’s</p>
<p>this?” It was a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with</p>
<p>mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I cannot think how I came to overlook it,” said the Inspector,</p>
<p>with an expression of annoyance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was</p>
<p>looking for it.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What! You expected to find it?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I thought it not unlikely.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>He took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of</p>
<p>each of them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to</p>
<p>the rim of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and</p>
<p>bushes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I am afraid that there are no more tracks,” said the Inspector.</p>
<p>“I have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in</p>
<p>each direction.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Indeed!” said Holmes, rising. “I should not have the</p>
<p>impertinence to do it again after what you say. But I should like</p>
<p>to take a little walk over the moor before it grows dark, that I</p>
<p>may know my ground to-morrow, and I think that I shall put this</p>
<p>horseshoe into my pocket for luck.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my</p>
<p>companion’s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his</p>
<p>watch. “I wish you would come back with me, Inspector,” said he.</p>
<p>“There are several points on which I should like your advice, and</p>
<p>especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove</p>
<p>our horse’s name from the entries for the Cup.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Certainly not,” cried Holmes, with decision. “I should let the</p>
<p>name stand.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Colonel bowed. “I am very glad to have had your opinion,</p>
<p>sir,” said he. “You will find us at poor Straker’s house when you</p>
<p>have finished your walk, and we can drive together into</p>
<p>Tavistock.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked</p>
<p>slowly across the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the</p>
<p>stables of Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us</p>
<p>was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns where the</p>
<p>faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. But the</p>
<p>glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who</p>
<p>was sunk in the deepest thought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s this way, Watson,” said he at last. “We may leave the</p>
<p>question of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine</p>
<p>ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. Now,</p>
<p>supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where</p>
<p>could he have gone to? The horse is a very gregarious creature.</p>
<p>If left to himself his instincts would have been either to return</p>
<p>to King’s Pyland or go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild</p>
<p>upon the moor? He would surely have been seen by now. And why</p>
<p>should gypsies kidnap him? These people always clear out when</p>
<p>they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the</p>
<p>police. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run</p>
<p>a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. Surely that is</p>
<p>clear.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Where is he, then?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have already said that he must have gone to King’s Pyland or</p>
<p>to Mapleton. He is not at King’s Pyland. Therefore he is at</p>
<p>Mapleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what</p>
<p>it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked,</p>
<p>is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Mapleton, and you</p>
<p>can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which</p>
<p>must have been very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is</p>
<p>correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the</p>
<p>point where we should look for his tracks.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few</p>
<p>more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes’</p>
<p>request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left,</p>
<p>but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout,</p>
<p>and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was</p>
<p>plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe</p>
<p>which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“See the value of imagination,” said Holmes. “It is the one</p>
<p>quality which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have</p>
<p>happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves</p>
<p>justified. Let us proceed.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile</p>
<p>of dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on</p>
<p>the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick</p>
<p>them up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw</p>
<p>them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his</p>
<p>face. A man’s track was visible beside the horse’s.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The horse was alone before,” I cried.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of</p>
<p>King’s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after</p>
<p>it. His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little</p>
<p>to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back</p>
<p>again in the opposite direction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“One for you, Watson,” said Holmes, when I pointed it out. “You</p>
<p>have saved us a long walk, which would have brought us back on</p>
<p>our own traces. Let us follow the return track.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led</p>
<p>up to the gates of the Mapleton stables. As we approached, a</p>
<p>groom ran out from them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We don’t want any loiterers about here,” said he.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I only wished to ask a question,” said Holmes, with his finger</p>
<p>and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. “Should I be too early to see</p>
<p>your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o’clock</p>
<p>to-morrow morning?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always</p>
<p>the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions</p>
<p>for himself. No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to</p>
<p>let him see me touch your money. Afterwards, if you like.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn</p>
<p>from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the</p>
<p>gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What’s this, Dawson!” he cried. “No gossiping! Go about your</p>
<p>business! And you, what the devil do you want here?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,” said Holmes in the</p>
<p>sweetest of voices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We want no strangers</p>
<p>here. Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer’s</p>
<p>ear. He started violently and flushed to the temples.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s a lie!” he shouted, “an infernal lie!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it</p>
<p>over in your parlour?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh, come in if you wish to.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holmes smiled. “I shall not keep you more than a few minutes,</p>
<p>Watson,” said he. “Now, Mr. Brown, I am quite at your disposal.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into greys</p>
<p>before Holmes and the trainer reappeared. Never have I seen such</p>
<p>a change as had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short</p>
<p>time. His face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration shone upon</p>
<p>his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged like</p>
<p>a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all</p>
<p>gone too, and he cringed along at my companion’s side like a dog</p>
<p>with its master.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Your instructions will be done. It shall all be done,” said he.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“There must be no mistake,” said Holmes, looking round at him.</p>
<p>The other winced as he read the menace in his eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I</p>
<p>change it first or not?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. “No, don’t,”</p>
<p>said he; “I shall write to you about it. No tricks, now, or—”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow.” He</p>
<p>turned upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the</p>
<p>other held out to him, and we set off for King’s Pyland.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than</p>
<p>Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with,” remarked Holmes as we</p>
<p>trudged along together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“He has the horse, then?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly</p>
<p>what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced</p>
<p>that I was watching him. Of course you observed the peculiarly</p>
<p>square toes in the impressions, and that his own boots exactly</p>
<p>corresponded to them. Again, of course no subordinate would have</p>
<p>dared to do such a thing. I described to him how, when according</p>
<p>to his custom he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse</p>
<p>wandering over the moor. How he went out to it, and his</p>
<p>astonishment at recognising, from the white forehead which has</p>
<p>given the favourite its name, that chance had put in his power</p>
<p>the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his</p>
<p>money. Then I described how his first impulse had been to lead</p>
<p>him back to King’s Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he</p>
<p>could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led</p>
<p>it back and concealed it at Mapleton. When I told him every</p>
<p>detail he gave it up and thought only of saving his own skin.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“But his stables had been searched?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh, an old horse-faker like him has many a dodge.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now,</p>
<p>since he has every interest in injuring it?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. He</p>
<p>knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Colonel Ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to</p>
<p>show much mercy in any case.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The matter does not rest with Colonel Ross. I follow my own</p>
<p>methods, and tell as much or as little as I choose. That is the</p>
<p>advantage of being unofficial. I don’t know whether you observed</p>
<p>it, Watson, but the Colonel’s manner has been just a trifle</p>
<p>cavalier to me. I am inclined now to have a little amusement at</p>
<p>his expense. Say nothing to him about the horse.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Certainly not without your permission.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the</p>
<p>question of who killed John Straker.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And you will devote yourself to that?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“On the contrary, we both go back to London by the night train.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was thunderstruck by my friend’s words. We had only been a few</p>
<p>hours in Devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation</p>
<p>which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to</p>
<p>me. Not a word more could I draw from him until we were back at</p>
<p>the trainer’s house. The Colonel and the Inspector were awaiting</p>
<p>us in the parlour.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My friend and I return to town by the night-express,” said</p>
<p>Holmes. “We have had a charming little breath of your beautiful</p>
<p>Dartmoor air.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel’s lip curled in a</p>
<p>sneer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,” said</p>
<p>he.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “There are certainly grave</p>
<p>difficulties in the way,” said he. “I have every hope, however,</p>
<p>that your horse will start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will</p>
<p>have your jockey in readiness. Might I ask for a photograph of</p>
<p>Mr. John Straker?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Inspector took one from an envelope and handed it to him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants. If I might ask you</p>
<p>to wait here for an instant, I have a question which I should</p>
<p>like to put to the maid.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I must say that I am rather disappointed in our London</p>
<p>consultant,” said Colonel Ross, bluntly, as my friend left the</p>
<p>room. “I do not see that we are any further than when he came.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“At least you have his assurance that your horse will run,” said</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, I have his assurance,” said the Colonel, with a shrug of</p>
<p>his shoulders. “I should prefer to have the horse.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was about to make some reply in defence of my friend when he</p>
<p>entered the room again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Now, gentlemen,” said he, “I am quite ready for Tavistock.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we stepped into the carriage one of the stable-lads held the</p>
<p>door open for us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he</p>
<p>leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You have a few sheep in the paddock,” he said. “Who attends to</p>
<p>them?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I do, sir.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone</p>
<p>lame, sir.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled</p>
<p>and rubbed his hands together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A long shot, Watson; a very long shot,” said he, pinching my</p>
<p>arm. “Gregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular</p>
<p>epidemic among the sheep. Drive on, coachman!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Colonel Ross still wore an expression which showed the poor</p>
<p>opinion which he had formed of my companion’s ability, but I saw</p>
<p>by the Inspector’s face that his attention had been keenly</p>
<p>aroused.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You consider that to be important?” he asked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Exceedingly so.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my</p>
<p>attention?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The dog did nothing in the night-time.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Four days later Holmes and I were again in the train, bound for</p>
<p>Winchester to see the race for the Wessex Cup. Colonel Ross met</p>
<p>us by appointment outside the station, and we drove in his drag</p>
<p>to the course beyond the town. His face was grave, and his manner</p>
<p>was cold in the extreme.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have seen nothing of my horse,” said he.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?” asked</p>
<p>Holmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Colonel was very angry. “I have been on the turf for twenty</p>
<p>years, and never was asked such a question as that before,” said</p>
<p>he. “A child would know Silver Blaze, with his white forehead and</p>
<p>his mottled off-foreleg.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“How is the betting?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, that is the curious part of it. You could have got fifteen</p>
<p>to one yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter,</p>
<p>until you can hardly get three to one now.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hum!” said Holmes. “Somebody knows something, that is clear.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grand stand I</p>
<p>glanced at the card to see the entries. It ran:—</p>
<p></p>
<p>Wessex Plate. 50 sovs each h ft with 1000 sovs added for four and</p>
<p>five year olds. Second, £300. Third, £200. New course (one mile</p>
<p>and five furlongs).</p>
<p>1. Mr. Heath Newton’s The Negro (red cap, cinnamon jacket).</p>
<p>2. Colonel Wardlaw’s Pugilist (pink cap, blue and black jacket).</p>
<p>3. Lord Backwater’s Desborough (yellow cap and sleeves).</p>
<p>4. Colonel Ross’s Silver Blaze (black cap, red jacket).</p>
<p>5. Duke of Balmoral’s Iris (yellow and black stripes).</p>
<p>6. Lord Singleford’s Rasper (purple cap, black sleeves).</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,”</p>
<p>said the Colonel. “Why, what is that? Silver Blaze favourite?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Five to four against Silver Blaze!” roared the ring. “Five to</p>
<p>four against Silver Blaze! Five to fifteen against Desborough!</p>
<p>Five to four on the field!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“There are the numbers up,” I cried. “They are all six there.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“All six there? Then my horse is running,” cried the Colonel in</p>
<p>great agitation. “But I don’t see him. My colours have not</p>
<p>passed.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Only five have passed. This must be he.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing</p>
<p>enclosure and cantered past us, bearing on its back the</p>
<p>well-known black and red of the Colonel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“That’s not my horse,” cried the owner. “That beast has not a</p>
<p>white hair upon its body. What is this that you have done, Mr.</p>
<p>Holmes?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, well, let us see how he gets on,” said my friend,</p>
<p>imperturbably. For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass.</p>
<p>“Capital! An excellent start!” he cried suddenly. “There they</p>
<p>are, coming round the curve!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight.</p>
<p>The six horses were so close together that a carpet could have</p>
<p>covered them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable</p>
<p>showed to the front. Before they reached us, however,</p>
<p>Desborough’s bolt was shot, and the Colonel’s horse, coming away</p>
<p>with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival,</p>
<p>the Duke of Balmoral’s Iris making a bad third.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s my race, anyhow,” gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over</p>
<p>his eyes. “I confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it.</p>
<p>Don’t you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough,</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Certainly, Colonel, you shall know everything. Let us all go</p>
<p>round and have a look at the horse together. Here he is,” he</p>
<p>continued, as we made our way into the weighing enclosure, where</p>
<p>only owners and their friends find admittance. “You have only to</p>
<p>wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find</p>
<p>that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You take my breath away!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of</p>
<p>running him just as he was sent over.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My dear sir, you have done wonders. The horse looks very fit and</p>
<p>well. It never went better in its life. I owe you a thousand</p>
<p>apologies for having doubted your ability. You have done me a</p>
<p>great service by recovering my horse. You would do me a greater</p>
<p>still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John</p>
<p>Straker.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have done so,” said Holmes quietly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement. “You have got him!</p>
<p>Where is he, then?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“He is here.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Here! Where?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“In my company at the present moment.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Colonel flushed angrily. “I quite recognise that I am under</p>
<p>obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but I must regard what</p>
<p>you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes laughed. “I assure you that I have not associated</p>
<p>you with the crime, Colonel,” said he. “The real murderer is</p>
<p>standing immediately behind you.” He stepped past and laid his</p>
<p>hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The horse!” cried both the Colonel and myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, the horse. And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was</p>
<p>done in self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was</p>
<p>entirely unworthy of your confidence. But there goes the bell,</p>
<p>and as I stand to win a little on this next race, I shall defer a</p>
<p>lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as</p>
<p>we whirled back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a</p>
<p>short one to Colonel Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to</p>
<p>our companion’s narrative of the events which had occurred at the</p>
<p>Dartmoor training-stables upon the Monday night, and the means by</p>
<p>which he had unravelled them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I confess,” said he, “that any theories which I had formed from</p>
<p>the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. And yet there were</p>
<p>indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details</p>
<p>which concealed their true import. I went to Devonshire with the</p>
<p>conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although,</p>
<p>of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means</p>
<p>complete. It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached</p>
<p>the trainer’s house, that the immense significance of the curried</p>
<p>mutton occurred to me. You may remember that I was distrait, and</p>
<p>remained sitting after you had all alighted. I was marvelling in</p>
<p>my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a</p>
<p>clue.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I confess,” said the Colonel, “that even now I cannot see how it</p>
<p>helps us.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It was the first link in my chain of reasoning. Powdered opium</p>
<p>is by no means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it</p>
<p>is perceptible. Were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater</p>
<p>would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A</p>
<p>curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By</p>
<p>no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson,</p>
<p>have caused curry to be served in the trainer’s family that</p>
<p>night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose</p>
<p>that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very</p>
<p>night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the</p>
<p>flavour. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes</p>
<p>eliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon Straker</p>
<p>and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried</p>
<p>mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish</p>
<p>was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for</p>
<p>supper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to</p>
<p>that dish without the maid seeing them?</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of</p>
<p>the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably</p>
<p>suggests others. The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was</p>
<p>kept in the stables, and yet, though some one had been in and had</p>
<p>fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two</p>
<p>lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one</p>
<p>whom the dog knew well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker</p>
<p>went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out</p>
<p>Silver Blaze. For what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously,</p>
<p>or why should he drug his own stable-boy? And yet I was at a loss</p>
<p>to know why. There have been cases before now where trainers have</p>
<p>made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own</p>
<p>horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by</p>
<p>fraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some</p>
<p>surer and subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that the</p>
<p>contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife</p>
<p>which was found in the dead man’s hand, a knife which certainly</p>
<p>no sane man would choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told</p>
<p>us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate</p>
<p>operations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate</p>
<p>operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of</p>
<p>turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight</p>
<p>nick upon the tendons of a horse’s ham, and to do it</p>
<p>subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so</p>
<p>treated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down</p>
<p>to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to</p>
<p>foul play.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Villain! Scoundrel!” cried the Colonel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take</p>
<p>the horse out on to the moor. So spirited a creature would have</p>
<p>certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick</p>
<p>of the knife. It was absolutely necessary to do it in the open</p>
<p>air.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have been blind!” cried the Colonel. “Of course that was why</p>
<p>he needed the candle, and struck the match.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Undoubtedly. But in examining his belongings I was fortunate</p>
<p>enough to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its</p>
<p>motives. As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not</p>
<p>carry other people’s bills about in their pockets. We have most</p>
<p>of us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once concluded</p>
<p>that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second</p>
<p>establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a</p>
<p>lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as</p>
<p>you are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can</p>
<p>buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I questioned</p>
<p>Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having</p>
<p>satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of</p>
<p>the milliner’s address, and felt that by calling there with</p>
<p>Straker’s photograph I could easily dispose of the mythical</p>
<p>Derbyshire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“From that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse</p>
<p>to a hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson in his</p>
<p>flight had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up—with</p>
<p>some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse’s</p>
<p>leg. Once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had</p>
<p>struck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare,</p>
<p>and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some</p>
<p>mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had</p>
<p>struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite of</p>
<p>the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate</p>
<p>task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make</p>
<p>it clear?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Wonderful!” cried the Colonel. “Wonderful! You might have been</p>
<p>there!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My final shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that</p>
<p>so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate</p>
<p>tendon-nicking without a little practice. What could he practice</p>
<p>on? My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which,</p>
<p>rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“When I returned to London I called upon the milliner, who had</p>
<p>recognised Straker as an excellent customer of the name of</p>
<p>Derbyshire, who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality</p>
<p>for expensive dresses. I have no doubt that this woman had</p>
<p>plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this</p>
<p>miserable plot.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You have explained all but one thing,” cried the Colonel. “Where</p>
<p>was the horse?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Ah, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbours. We</p>
<p>must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham</p>
<p>Junction, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in</p>
<p>less than ten minutes. If you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms,</p>
<p>Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which</p>
<p>might interest you.”</p>
