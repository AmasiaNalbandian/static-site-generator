<h1>The Red Headed League</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn</p>
<p>of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout,</p>
<p>florid-faced, elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. With an apology</p>
<p>for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes pulled me</p>
<p>abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he</p>
<p>said, cordially.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I was afraid that you were engaged.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So I am. Very much so.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Then I can wait in the next room.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper</p>
<p>in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will</p>
<p>be of the utmost use to me in yours also.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The stout gentleman half-rose from his chair and gave a bob of</p>
<p>greeting, with a quick, little, questioning glance from his small,</p>
<p>fat-encircled eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his arm-chair and putting</p>
<p>his finger-tips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I</p>
<p>know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and</p>
<p>outside the conventions and humdrum routine of every-day life. You have</p>
<p>shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to</p>
<p>chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish</p>
<p>so many of my own little adventures.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I</p>
<p>observed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went</p>
<p>into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that</p>
<p>for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to</p>
<p>life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the</p>
<p>imagination.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view,</p>
<p>for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you, until your</p>
<p>reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.</p>
<p>Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,</p>
<p>and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular</p>
<p>which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that</p>
<p>the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with</p>
<p>the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where</p>
<p>there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.</p>
<p>As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the</p>
<p>present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events</p>
<p>is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.</p>
<p>Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence</p>
<p>your narrative. I ask you, not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has</p>
<p>not heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the</p>
<p>story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.</p>
<p>As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of</p>
<p>events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar</p>
<p>cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to</p>
<p>admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some</p>
<p>little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside</p>
<p>pocket of his great-coat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,</p>
<p>with his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out upon his</p>
<p>knee, I took a good look at the man, and endeavored, after the fashion</p>
<p>of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by</p>
<p>his dress or appearance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore</p>
<p>every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,</p>
<p>pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy gray shepherd’s check trousers,</p>
<p>a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab</p>
<p>waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of</p>
<p>metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown</p>
<p>overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.</p>
<p>Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man</p>
<p>save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and</p>
<p>discontent upon his features.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes’s quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his</p>
<p>head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the</p>
<p>obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that he takes</p>
<p>snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he</p>
<p>has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing</p>
<p>else.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the</p>
<p>paper, but his eyes upon my companion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?”</p>
<p>he asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labor. It’s</p>
<p>as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than</p>
<p>your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,</p>
<p>especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use</p>
<p>an arc-and-compass breastpin.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five</p>
<p>inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you</p>
<p>rest it upon the desk.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, but China?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist</p>
<p>could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo</p>
<p>marks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.</p>
<p>That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite</p>
<p>peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from</p>
<p>your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought</p>
<p>at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was</p>
<p>nothing in it, after all.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in</p>
<p>explaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you know, and my poor little</p>
<p>reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can</p>
<p>you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered, with his thick, red finger</p>
<p>planted half-way down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it</p>
<p>all. You just read it for yourself, sir.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I took the paper from him, and read as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>  “TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the</p>
<p>  late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A., there is now</p>
<p>  another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League</p>
<p>  to a salary of £4 a week for purely nominal services. All</p>
<p>  red-headed men who are sound in body and mind, and above</p>
<p>  the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on</p>
<p>  Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of</p>
<p>  the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated, after I had twice read</p>
<p>over the extraordinary announcement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in</p>
<p>high spirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said</p>
<p>he. “And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about</p>
<p>yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had</p>
<p>upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, doctor, of the paper</p>
<p>and the date.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It is _The Morning Chronicle_, of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”</p>
<p>said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s</p>
<p>business at Coburg Square, near the city. It’s not a very large affair,</p>
<p>and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I</p>
<p>used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I</p>
<p>would have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half</p>
<p>wages, so as to learn the business.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s</p>
<p>hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;</p>
<p>and I know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what</p>
<p>I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I</p>
<p>put ideas in his head?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who</p>
<p>comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among</p>
<p>employers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as</p>
<p>remarkable as your advertisement.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow</p>
<p>for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be</p>
<p>improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit</p>
<p>into its hole to develope his pictures. That is his main fault; but, on</p>
<p>the whole, he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“He is still with you, I presume?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking,</p>
<p>and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a</p>
<p>widower, and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three</p>
<p>of us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do</p>
<p>nothing more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he</p>
<p>came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very</p>
<p>paper in his hand, and he says:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Why that?’ I asks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the</p>
<p>Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets</p>
<p>it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,</p>
<p>so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.</p>
<p>If my hair would only change color, here’s a nice little crib all ready</p>
<p>for me to step into.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very</p>
<p>stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having</p>
<p>to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the</p>
<p>door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,</p>
<p>and I was always glad of a bit of news.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked,</p>
<p>with his eyes open.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Never.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the</p>
<p>vacancies.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it</p>
<p>need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the</p>
<p>business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of</p>
<p>hundred would have been very handy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for</p>
<p>yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address</p>
<p>where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the</p>
<p>League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who</p>
<p>was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a</p>
<p>great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found</p>
<p>that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with</p>
<p>instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to</p>
<p>men whose hair is of that color. From all I hear it is splendid pay,</p>
<p>and very little to do.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would</p>
<p>apply.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really</p>
<p>confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from</p>
<p>London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.</p>
<p>Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is</p>
<p>light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery</p>
<p>red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;</p>
<p>but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of</p>
<p>the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my</p>
<p>hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if</p>
<p>there was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance</p>
<p>as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so</p>
<p>much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered</p>
<p>him to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me.</p>
<p>He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and</p>
<p>started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From</p>
<p>north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his</p>
<p>hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet</p>
<p>Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked</p>
<p>like a coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were</p>
<p>so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single</p>
<p>advertisement. Every shade of color they were—straw, lemon, orange,</p>
<p>brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were</p>
<p>not many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. When I saw how many</p>
<p>were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would</p>
<p>not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and</p>
<p>pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to</p>
<p>the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the</p>
<p>stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we</p>
<p>wedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes, as</p>
<p>his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.</p>
<p>“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a</p>
<p>deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even</p>
<p>redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came</p>
<p>up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would</p>
<p>disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy</p>
<p>matter, after all. However, when our turn came, the little man was much</p>
<p>more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door</p>
<p>as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to</p>
<p>fill a vacancy in the League.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every</p>
<p>requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He</p>
<p>took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair</p>
<p>until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my</p>
<p>hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am</p>
<p>sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized</p>
<p>my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.</p>
<p>‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he, as he released me. ‘I perceive</p>
<p>that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have</p>
<p>twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales</p>
<p>of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped</p>
<p>over to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that</p>
<p>the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,</p>
<p>and the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was</p>
<p>not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the</p>
<p>pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a</p>
<p>married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I answered that I had not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“His face fell immediately.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Dear me!’ he said, gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry</p>
<p>to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation</p>
<p>and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is</p>
<p>exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not</p>
<p>to have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over for a few</p>
<p>minutes, he said that it would be all right.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but</p>
<p>we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as</p>
<p>yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I</p>
<p>shall be able to look after that for you.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Ten to two.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,</p>
<p>especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;</p>
<p>so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.</p>
<p>Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see</p>
<p>to anything that turned up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Is £4 a week.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘And the work?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Is purely nominal.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘What do you call purely nominal?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the</p>
<p>whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.</p>
<p>The will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the</p>
<p>conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross, ‘neither sickness nor</p>
<p>business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your</p>
<p>billet.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘And the work?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Is to copy out the “Encyclopædia Britannica.” There is the first</p>
<p>volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and</p>
<p>blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready</p>
<p>to-morrow?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Certainly,’ I answered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once</p>
<p>more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to</p>
<p>gain.’ He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant,</p>
<p>hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good</p>
<p>fortune.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in</p>
<p>low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole</p>
<p>affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might</p>
<p>be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that any one</p>
<p>could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing</p>
<p>anything so simple as copying out the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica.’</p>
<p>Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I</p>
<p>had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning</p>
<p>I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle</p>
<p>of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I</p>
<p>started off for Pope’s Court.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.</p>
<p>The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to</p>
<p>see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and</p>
<p>then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all</p>
<p>was right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me</p>
<p>upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office</p>
<p>after me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager</p>
<p>came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work.</p>
<p>It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning</p>
<p>I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.</p>
<p>Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after</p>
<p>a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to</p>
<p>leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,</p>
<p>and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would</p>
<p>not risk the loss of it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and</p>
<p>Archery and Armor and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence</p>
<p>that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something</p>
<p>in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.</p>
<p>And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“To an end?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual</p>
<p>at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square</p>
<p>of card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here</p>
<p>it is, and you can read for yourself.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>He held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of</p>
<p>note-paper. It read in this fashion:</p>
<p></p>
<p>  “THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</p>
<p>   IS</p>
<p>   DISSOLVED.</p>
<p>   _October 9, 1890._”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful</p>
<p>face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely</p>
<p>overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar</p>
<p>of laughter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,</p>
<p>flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing</p>
<p>better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he</p>
<p>had half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is</p>
<p>most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying</p>
<p>so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you</p>
<p>take when you found the card upon the door?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at</p>
<p>the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.</p>
<p>Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the</p>
<p>ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of</p>
<p>the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such</p>
<p>body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the</p>
<p>name was new to him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Illustration: “THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED”]</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘What, the red-headed man?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Yes.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor, and</p>
<p>was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises</p>
<p>were ready. He moved out yesterday.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Where could I find him?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King</p>
<p>Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a</p>
<p>manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of</p>
<p>either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my</p>
<p>assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that</p>
<p>if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,</p>
<p>as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk</p>
<p>who were in need of it, I came right away to you.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly</p>
<p>remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you</p>
<p>have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from</p>
<p>it than might at first sight appear.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a</p>
<p>week.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not</p>
<p>see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On</p>
<p>the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £30, to say</p>
<p>nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject</p>
<p>which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what</p>
<p>their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It</p>
<p>was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty</p>
<p>pounds.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And, first, one</p>
<p>or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called</p>
<p>your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“About a month then.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“How did he come?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“In answer to an advertisement.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Was he the only applicant?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“No, I had a dozen.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Why did you pick him?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Because he was handy, and would come cheap.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“At half-wages, in fact.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,</p>
<p>though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his</p>
<p>forehead.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as</p>
<p>much,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for</p>
<p>earrings?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a</p>
<p>lad.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with</p>
<p>you?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh yes, sir; I have only just left him.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a</p>
<p>morning.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon</p>
<p>the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I</p>
<p>hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, Watson,” said Holmes, when our visitor had left us, “what do you</p>
<p>make of it all?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I make nothing of it,” I answered, frankly. “It is a most mysterious</p>
<p>business.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less</p>
<p>mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes</p>
<p>which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most</p>
<p>difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg</p>
<p>that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up</p>
<p>in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and</p>
<p>there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out</p>
<p>like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that</p>
<p>he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly</p>
<p>sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his</p>
<p>mind, and put his pipe down upon the mantel-piece.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few</p>
<p>hours?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the city first, and</p>
<p>we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal</p>
<p>of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than</p>
<p>Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come</p>
<p>along!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk</p>
<p>took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we</p>
<p>had listened to in the morning. It was a pokey, little, shabby-genteel</p>
<p>place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out</p>
<p>into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and</p>
<p>a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a</p>
<p>smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown</p>
<p>board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner</p>
<p>house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his</p>
<p>business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one</p>
<p>side, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between</p>
<p>puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again</p>
<p>to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned</p>
<p>to the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement</p>
<p>with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.</p>
<p>It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow,</p>
<p>who asked him to step in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go</p>
<p>from here to the Strand.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant, promptly, closing</p>
<p>the door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes, as we walked away. “He is, in my</p>
<p>judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not</p>
<p>sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him</p>
<p>before.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in</p>
<p>this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your</p>
<p>way merely in order that you might see him.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Not him.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What then?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The knees of his trousers.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And what did you see?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“What I expected to see.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Why did you beat the pavement?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are</p>
<p>spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.</p>
<p>Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner</p>
<p>from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to</p>
<p>it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main</p>
<p>arteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west.</p>
<p>The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing</p>
<p>in a double tide inward and outward, while the foot-paths were black</p>
<p>with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize</p>
<p>as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises</p>
<p>that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant</p>
<p>square which we had just quitted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along</p>
<p>the line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.</p>
<p>It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is</p>
<p>Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg</p>
<p>branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and</p>
<p>McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the</p>
<p>other block. And now, doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had</p>
<p>some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,</p>
<p>where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no</p>
<p>red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a</p>
<p>very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the</p>
<p>afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,</p>
<p>gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his</p>
<p>gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those</p>
<p>of Holmes, the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,</p>
<p>ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his</p>
<p>singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and</p>
<p>his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often</p>
<p>thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which</p>
<p>occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from</p>
<p>extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never</p>
<p>so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in</p>
<p>his arm-chair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.</p>
<p>Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,</p>
<p>and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of</p>
<p>intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would</p>
<p>look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other</p>
<p>mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enrapt in the music at St.</p>
<p>James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom</p>
<p>he had set himself to hunt down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You want to go home, no doubt, doctor,” he remarked, as we emerged.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, it would be as well.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This</p>
<p>business at Coburg Square is serious.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Why serious?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to</p>
<p>believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday</p>
<p>rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“At what time?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Ten will be early enough.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Very well. And, I say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so</p>
<p>kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand,</p>
<p>turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Illustration: “ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS”]</p>
<p></p>
<p>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I was always</p>
<p>oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock</p>
<p>Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had</p>
<p>seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not</p>
<p>only what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the</p>
<p>whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to</p>
<p>my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary</p>
<p>story of the red-headed copier of the “Encyclopædia” down to the visit</p>
<p>to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted</p>
<p>from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?</p>
<p>Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes</p>
<p>that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a</p>
<p>man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it</p>
<p>up in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an</p>
<p>explanation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way</p>
<p>across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two</p>
<p>hansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I</p>
<p>heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found</p>
<p>Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized</p>
<p>as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long,</p>
<p>thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable</p>
<p>frock-coat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Ha! our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket,</p>
<p>and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think</p>
<p>you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.</p>
<p>Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We’re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,” said Jones, in his</p>
<p>consequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a</p>
<p>chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”</p>
<p>observed Mr. Merryweather, gloomily.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the</p>
<p>police agent, loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he</p>
<p>won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,</p>
<p>but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to</p>
<p>say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and</p>
<p>the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official</p>
<p>force.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger,</p>
<p>with deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the</p>
<p>first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my</p>
<p>rubber.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for</p>
<p>a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play</p>
<p>will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be</p>
<p>some £30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish</p>
<p>to lay your hands.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,</p>
<p>Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would</p>
<p>rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a</p>
<p>remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,</p>
<p>and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as</p>
<p>his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never</p>
<p>know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one</p>
<p>week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.</p>
<p>I’ve been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve</p>
<p>had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with</p>
<p>you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,</p>
<p>and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,</p>
<p>Watson and I will follow in the second.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive,</p>
<p>and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the</p>
<p>afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets</p>
<p>until we emerged into Farringdon Street.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather</p>
<p>is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought</p>
<p>it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though</p>
<p>an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He</p>
<p>is as brave as a bull-dog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his</p>
<p>claws upon any one. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found</p>
<p>ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following</p>
<p>the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage</p>
<p>and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a</p>
<p>small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was</p>
<p>opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated</p>
<p>at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a</p>
<p>lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and</p>
<p>so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was</p>
<p>piled all round with crates and massive boxes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked, as he held</p>
<p>up the lantern and gazed about him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the</p>
<p>flags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he</p>
<p>remarked, looking up in surprise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet,” said Holmes,</p>
<p>severely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our</p>
<p>expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down</p>
<p>upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very</p>
<p>injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees</p>
<p>upon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to</p>
<p>examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed</p>
<p>to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in</p>
<p>his pocket.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked; “for they can</p>
<p>hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.</p>
<p>Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work</p>
<p>the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,</p>
<p>doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the city branch</p>
<p>of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman</p>
<p>of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the</p>
<p>more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in</p>
<p>this cellar at present.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several</p>
<p>warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Your French gold?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and</p>
<p>borrowed, for that purpose, 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.</p>
<p>It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the</p>
<p>money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which</p>
<p>I sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our</p>
<p>reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a</p>
<p>single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the</p>
<p>subject.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time</p>
<p>that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters</p>
<p>will come to a head. In the mean time, Mr. Merryweather, we must put</p>
<p>the screen over that dark lantern.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And sit in the dark?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I</p>
<p>thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber</p>
<p>after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far</p>
<p>that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must</p>
<p>choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take</p>
<p>them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.</p>
<p>I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind</p>
<p>those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they</p>
<p>fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind</p>
<p>which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his</p>
<p>lantern, and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness</p>
<p>as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained</p>
<p>to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at</p>
<p>a moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of</p>
<p>expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden</p>
<p>gloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through</p>
<p>the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I</p>
<p>asked you, Jones?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and</p>
<p>wait.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an</p>
<p>hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have</p>
<p>almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and</p>
<p>stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked</p>
<p>up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I</p>
<p>could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could</p>
<p>distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the</p>
<p>thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look</p>
<p>over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught</p>
<p>the glint of a light.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it</p>
<p>lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any</p>
<p>warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared; a white,</p>
<p>almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area</p>
<p>of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,</p>
<p>protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it</p>
<p>appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which</p>
<p>marked a chink between the stones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing</p>
<p>sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and</p>
<p>left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a</p>
<p>lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which</p>
<p>looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the</p>
<p>aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee</p>
<p>rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the</p>
<p>hole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like</p>
<p>himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags.</p>
<p>Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.</p>
<p>The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth</p>
<p>as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a</p>
<p>revolver, but Holmes’s hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and</p>
<p>the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes, blandly. “You have no chance at</p>
<p>all.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So I see,” the other answered, with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that</p>
<p>my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must</p>
<p>compliment you.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and</p>
<p>effective.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at</p>
<p>climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked</p>
<p>our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not</p>
<p>be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,</p>
<p>when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“All right,” said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you</p>
<p>please, sir, march up-stairs, where we can get a cab to carry your</p>
<p>highness to the police-station?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“That is better,” said John Clay, serenely. He made a sweeping bow to</p>
<p>the three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Really Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from</p>
<p>the cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most</p>
<p>complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery</p>
<p>that have ever come within my experience.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.</p>
<p>John Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this</p>
<p>matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am</p>
<p>amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,</p>
<p>and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You see, Watson,” he explained, in the early hours of the morning,</p>
<p>as we sat over a glass of whiskey-and-soda in Baker Street, “it was</p>
<p>perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this</p>
<p>rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the</p>
<p>copying of the ‘Encyclopædia,’ must be to get this not over-bright</p>
<p>pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a</p>
<p>curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to</p>
<p>suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious</p>
<p>mind by the color of his accomplice’s hair. The £4 a week was a lure</p>
<p>which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for</p>
<p>thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary</p>
<p>office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together</p>
<p>they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From</p>
<p>the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages,</p>
<p>it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the</p>
<p>situation.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“But how could you guess what the motive was?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere</p>
<p>vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s</p>
<p>business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which</p>
<p>could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure</p>
<p>as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What</p>
<p>could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography,</p>
<p>and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the</p>
<p>end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious</p>
<p>assistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest</p>
<p>and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the</p>
<p>cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What</p>
<p>could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was</p>
<p>running a tunnel to some other building.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I</p>
<p>surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was</p>
<p>ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.</p>
<p>It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the</p>
<p>assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never</p>
<p>set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His</p>
<p>knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how</p>
<p>worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of</p>
<p>burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I</p>
<p>walked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on</p>
<p>our friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you</p>
<p>drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard, and upon the</p>
<p>chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I</p>
<p>asked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they</p>
<p>cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words,</p>
<p>that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they</p>
<p>should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might</p>
<p>be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it</p>
<p>would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I</p>
<p>expected them to come to-night.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed, in unfeigned</p>
<p>admiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel</p>
<p>it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape</p>
<p>from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do</p>
<p>so.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some</p>
<p>little use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est</p>
<p>tout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to Georges Sand.”</p>
