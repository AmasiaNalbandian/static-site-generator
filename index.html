<h1>THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS
</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,
</p>
<p>to look in upon us of an evening, and his visits were welcome to
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch with all
</p>
<p>that was going on at the police headquarters. In return for the
</p>
<p>news which Lestrade would bring, Holmes was always ready to
</p>
<p>listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the
</p>
<p>detective was engaged, and was able occasionally, without any
</p>
<p>active interference, to give some hint or suggestion drawn from
</p>
<p>his own vast knowledge and experience.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>On this particular evening, Lestrade had spoken of the weather
</p>
<p>and the newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing
</p>
<p>thoughtfully at his cigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Anything remarkable on hand?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Oh, no, Mr. Holmes—nothing very particular.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Then tell me about it.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Lestrade laughed.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there _is_
</p>
<p>something on my mind. And yet it is such an absurd business, that
</p>
<p>I hesitated to bother you about it. On the other hand, although
</p>
<p>it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that you have
</p>
<p>a taste for all that is out of the common. But, in my opinion, it
</p>
<p>comes more in Dr. Watson’s line than ours.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Disease?” said I.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Madness, anyhow. And a queer madness, too. You wouldn’t think
</p>
<p>there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred
</p>
<p>of Napoleon the First that he would break any image of him that
</p>
<p>he could see.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes sank back in his chair.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“That’s no business of mine,” said he.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Exactly. That’s what I said. But then, when the man commits
</p>
<p>burglary in order to break images which are not his own, that
</p>
<p>brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes sat up again.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Burglary! This is more interesting. Let me hear the details.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his memory
</p>
<p>from its pages.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The first case reported was four days ago,” said he. “It was at
</p>
<p>the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of
</p>
<p>pictures and statues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had
</p>
<p>left the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and
</p>
<p>hurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood with
</p>
<p>several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered into
</p>
<p>fragments. He rushed out into the road, but, although several
</p>
<p>passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of the
</p>
<p>shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of
</p>
<p>identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those senseless
</p>
<p>acts of hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was
</p>
<p>reported to the constable on the beat as such. The plaster cast
</p>
<p>was not worth more than a few shillings, and the whole affair
</p>
<p>appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The second case, however, was more serious, and also more
</p>
<p>singular. It occurred only last night.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of Morse
</p>
<p>Hudson’s shop, there lives a well-known medical practitioner,
</p>
<p>named Dr. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices upon the
</p>
<p>south side of the Thames. His residence and principal
</p>
<p>consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but he has a branch
</p>
<p>surgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles away.
</p>
<p>This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his
</p>
<p>house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French
</p>
<p>Emperor. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two
</p>
<p>duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by the
</p>
<p>French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in his hall in
</p>
<p>the house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece of
</p>
<p>the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr. Barnicot came down
</p>
<p>this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been
</p>
<p>burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save
</p>
<p>the plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and had
</p>
<p>been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its
</p>
<p>splintered fragments were discovered.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes rubbed his hands.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“This is certainly very novel,” said he.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end
</p>
<p>yet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o’clock, and
</p>
<p>you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he found
</p>
<p>that the window had been opened in the night and that the broken
</p>
<p>pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room. It had
</p>
<p>been smashed to atoms where it stood. In neither case were there
</p>
<p>any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or
</p>
<p>lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes, you have got
</p>
<p>the facts.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“They are singular, not to say grotesque,” said Holmes. “May I
</p>
<p>ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot’s rooms were
</p>
<p>the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in Morse
</p>
<p>Hudson’s shop?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“They were taken from the same mould.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks
</p>
<p>them is influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon. Considering
</p>
<p>how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor must exist in
</p>
<p>London, it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a
</p>
<p>promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three
</p>
<p>specimens of the same bust.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well, I thought as you do,” said Lestrade. “On the other hand,
</p>
<p>this Morse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of
</p>
<p>London, and these three were the only ones which had been in his
</p>
<p>shop for years. So, although, as you say, there are many hundreds
</p>
<p>of statues in London, it is very probable that these three were
</p>
<p>the only ones in that district. Therefore, a local fanatic would
</p>
<p>begin with them. What do you think, Dr. Watson?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,” I
</p>
<p>answered. “There is the condition which the modern French
</p>
<p>psychologists have called the _idée fixe_, which may be trifling
</p>
<p>in character, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other
</p>
<p>way. A man who had read deeply about Napoleon, or who had
</p>
<p>possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great
</p>
<p>war, might conceivably form such an _idée fixe_ and under its
</p>
<p>influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“That won’t do, my dear Watson,” said Holmes, shaking his head,
</p>
<p>“for no amount of _idée fixe_ would enable your interesting
</p>
<p>monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well, how do _you_ explain it?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I don’t attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a
</p>
<p>certain method in the gentleman’s eccentric proceedings. For
</p>
<p>example, in Dr. Barnicot’s hall, where a sound might arouse the
</p>
<p>family, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas
</p>
<p>in the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was
</p>
<p>smashed where it stood. The affair seems absurdly trifling, and
</p>
<p>yet I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some of my
</p>
<p>most classic cases have had the least promising commencement. You
</p>
<p>will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of the Abernetty
</p>
<p>family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the
</p>
<p>parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I can’t afford,
</p>
<p>therefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I
</p>
<p>shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any
</p>
<p>fresh development of so singular a chain of events.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker
</p>
<p>and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined. I
</p>
<p>was still dressing in my bedroom next morning, when there was a
</p>
<p>tap at the door and Holmes entered, a telegram in his hand. He
</p>
<p>read it aloud:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Come instantly, 131, Pitt Street, Kensington.—LESTRADE.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“What is it, then?” I asked.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Don’t know—may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel of
</p>
<p>the story of the statues. In that case our friend the
</p>
<p>image-breaker has begun operations in another quarter of London.
</p>
<p>There’s coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the
</p>
<p>door.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little
</p>
<p>backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of London
</p>
<p>life. No. 131 was one of a row, all flat-chested, respectable,
</p>
<p>and most unromantic dwellings. As we drove up, we found the
</p>
<p>railings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd. Holmes
</p>
<p>whistled.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“By George! It’s attempted murder at the least. Nothing less will
</p>
<p>hold the London message-boy. There’s a deed of violence indicated
</p>
<p>in that fellow’s round shoulders and outstretched neck. What’s
</p>
<p>this, Watson? The top steps swilled down and the other ones dry.
</p>
<p>Footsteps enough, anyhow! Well, well, there’s Lestrade at the
</p>
<p>front window, and we shall soon know all about it.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The official received us with a very grave face and showed us
</p>
<p>into a sitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated
</p>
<p>elderly man, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and
</p>
<p>down. He was introduced to us as the owner of the house—Mr.
</p>
<p>Horace Harker, of the Central Press Syndicate.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“It’s the Napoleon bust business again,” said Lestrade. “You
</p>
<p>seemed interested last night, Mr. Holmes, so I thought perhaps
</p>
<p>you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a
</p>
<p>very much graver turn.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“What has it turned to, then?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“To murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly
</p>
<p>what has occurred?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most
</p>
<p>melancholy face.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“It’s an extraordinary thing,” said he, “that all my life I have
</p>
<p>been collecting other people’s news, and now that a real piece of
</p>
<p>news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that I
</p>
<p>can’t put two words together. If I had come in here as a
</p>
<p>journalist, I should have interviewed myself and had two columns
</p>
<p>in every evening paper. As it is, I am giving away valuable copy
</p>
<p>by telling my story over and over to a string of different
</p>
<p>people, and I can make no use of it myself. However, I’ve heard
</p>
<p>your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and if you’ll only explain this
</p>
<p>queer business, I shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the
</p>
<p>story.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes sat down and listened.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I
</p>
<p>bought for this very room about four months ago. I picked it up
</p>
<p>cheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street
</p>
<p>Station. A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night,
</p>
<p>and I often write until the early morning. So it was to-day. I
</p>
<p>was sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the
</p>
<p>house, about three o’clock, when I was convinced that I heard
</p>
<p>some sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated,
</p>
<p>and I concluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about
</p>
<p>five minutes later, there came a most horrible yell—the most
</p>
<p>dreadful sound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my
</p>
<p>ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or
</p>
<p>two. Then I seized the poker and went downstairs. When I entered
</p>
<p>this room I found the window wide open, and I at once observed
</p>
<p>that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. Why any burglar
</p>
<p>should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it was only
</p>
<p>a plaster cast and of no real value whatever.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open
</p>
<p>window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride.
</p>
<p>This was clearly what the burglar had done, so I went round and
</p>
<p>opened the door. Stepping out into the dark, I nearly fell over a
</p>
<p>dead man, who was lying there. I ran back for a light and there
</p>
<p>was the poor fellow, a great gash in his throat and the whole
</p>
<p>place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees drawn up,
</p>
<p>and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my dreams. I had
</p>
<p>just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must have
</p>
<p>fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman
</p>
<p>standing over me in the hall.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well, who was the murdered man?” asked Holmes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to show who he was,” said Lestrade. “You shall
</p>
<p>see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up
</p>
<p>to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than
</p>
<p>thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear to be a
</p>
<p>labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood
</p>
<p>beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the deed, or
</p>
<p>whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know. There was no
</p>
<p>name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save an apple,
</p>
<p>some string, a shilling map of London, and a photograph. Here it
</p>
<p>is.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. It
</p>
<p>represented an alert, sharp-featured simian man, with thick
</p>
<p>eyebrows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the
</p>
<p>face, like the muzzle of a baboon.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“And what became of the bust?” asked Holmes, after a careful
</p>
<p>study of this picture.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in the
</p>
<p>front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It was
</p>
<p>broken into fragments. I am going round now to see it. Will you
</p>
<p>come?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Certainly. I must just take one look round.” He examined the
</p>
<p>carpet and the window. “The fellow had either very long legs or
</p>
<p>was a most active man,” said he. “With an area beneath, it was no
</p>
<p>mean feat to reach that window ledge and open that window.
</p>
<p>Getting back was comparatively simple. Are you coming with us to
</p>
<p>see the remains of your bust, Mr. Harker?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a
</p>
<p>writing-table.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I must try and make something of it,” said he, “though I have no
</p>
<p>doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out
</p>
<p>already with full details. It’s like my luck! You remember when
</p>
<p>the stand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in
</p>
<p>the stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it,
</p>
<p>for I was too shaken to write it. And now I’ll be too late with a
</p>
<p>murder done on my own doorstep.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As we left the room, we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the
</p>
<p>foolscap.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only
</p>
<p>a few hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested upon
</p>
<p>this presentment of the great emperor, which seemed to raise such
</p>
<p>frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown. It lay
</p>
<p>scattered, in splintered shards, upon the grass. Holmes picked up
</p>
<p>several of them and examined them carefully. I was convinced,
</p>
<p>from his intent face and his purposeful manner, that at last he
</p>
<p>was upon a clue.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well?” asked Lestrade.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“We have a long way to go yet,” said he. “And yet—and yet—well,
</p>
<p>we have some suggestive facts to act upon. The possession of this
</p>
<p>trifling bust was worth more, in the eyes of this strange
</p>
<p>criminal, than a human life. That is one point. Then there is the
</p>
<p>singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or
</p>
<p>immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole
</p>
<p>object.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He
</p>
<p>hardly knew what he was doing.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well, that’s likely enough. But I wish to call your attention
</p>
<p>very particularly to the position of this house, in the garden of
</p>
<p>which the bust was destroyed.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Lestrade looked about him.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be
</p>
<p>disturbed in the garden.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street
</p>
<p>which he must have passed before he came to this one. Why did he
</p>
<p>not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he
</p>
<p>carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I give it up,” said Lestrade.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“He could see what he was doing here, and he could not there.
</p>
<p>That was his reason.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“By Jove! that’s true,” said the detective. “Now that I come to
</p>
<p>think of it, Dr. Barnicot’s bust was broken not far from his red
</p>
<p>lamp. Well, Mr. Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“To remember it—to docket it. We may come on something later
</p>
<p>which will bear upon it. What steps do you propose to take now,
</p>
<p>Lestrade?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to
</p>
<p>identify the dead man. There should be no difficulty about that.
</p>
<p>When we have found who he is and who his associates are, we
</p>
<p>should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt
</p>
<p>Street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on
</p>
<p>the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Don’t you think so?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should
</p>
<p>approach the case.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“What would you do then?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. I suggest that
</p>
<p>you go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes
</p>
<p>afterwards, and each will supplement the other.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Very good,” said Lestrade.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“If you are going back to Pitt Street, you might see Mr. Horace
</p>
<p>Harker. Tell him for me that I have quite made up my mind, and
</p>
<p>that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic, with
</p>
<p>Napoleonic delusions, was in his house last night. It will be
</p>
<p>useful for his article.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Lestrade stared.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“You don’t seriously believe that?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes smiled.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Don’t I? Well, perhaps I don’t. But I am sure that it will
</p>
<p>interest Mr. Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central
</p>
<p>Press Syndicate. Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we
</p>
<p>have a long and rather complex day’s work before us. I should be
</p>
<p>glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at
</p>
<p>Baker Street at six o’clock this evening. Until then I should
</p>
<p>like to keep this photograph, found in the dead man’s pocket. It
</p>
<p>is possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance
</p>
<p>upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken to-night,
</p>
<p>if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until then
</p>
<p>good-bye and good luck!”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street, where
</p>
<p>we stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had
</p>
<p>been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding
</p>
<p>would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself a
</p>
<p>newcomer, who could give us no information. Holmes’s face showed
</p>
<p>his disappointment and annoyance.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well, well, we can’t expect to have it all our own way, Watson,”
</p>
<p>he said, at last. “We must come back in the afternoon, if Mr.
</p>
<p>Harding will not be here until then. I am, as you have no doubt
</p>
<p>surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in
</p>
<p>order to find if there is not something peculiar which may
</p>
<p>account for their remarkable fate. Let us make for Mr. Morse
</p>
<p>Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can throw any light
</p>
<p>upon the problem.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer’s
</p>
<p>establishment. He was a small, stout man with a red face and a
</p>
<p>peppery manner.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,” said he. “What we pay rates
</p>
<p>and taxes for I don’t know, when any ruffian can come in and
</p>
<p>break one’s goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his
</p>
<p>two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot—that’s what I make
</p>
<p>it. No one but an anarchist would go about breaking statues. Red
</p>
<p>republicans—that’s what I call ’em. Who did I get the statues
</p>
<p>from? I don’t see what that has to do with it. Well, if you
</p>
<p>really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in Church
</p>
<p>Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the trade, and
</p>
<p>have been this twenty years. How many had I? Three—two and one
</p>
<p>are three—two of Dr. Barnicot’s, and one smashed in broad
</p>
<p>daylight on my own counter. Do I know that photograph? No, I
</p>
<p>don’t. Yes, I do, though. Why, it’s Beppo. He was a kind of
</p>
<p>Italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. He
</p>
<p>could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and do odd jobs. The
</p>
<p>fellow left me last week, and I’ve heard nothing of him since.
</p>
<p>No, I don’t know where he came from nor where he went to. I had
</p>
<p>nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two days
</p>
<p>before the bust was smashed.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well, that’s all we could reasonably expect from Morse Hudson,”
</p>
<p>said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. “We have this Beppo as
</p>
<p>a common factor, both in Kennington and in Kensington, so that is
</p>
<p>worth a ten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let us make for Gelder &
</p>
<p>Co., of Stepney, the source and origin of the busts. I shall be
</p>
<p>surprised if we don’t get some help down there.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable
</p>
<p>London, hotel London, theatrical London, literary London,
</p>
<p>commercial London, and, finally, maritime London, till we came to
</p>
<p>a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the tenement
</p>
<p>houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of Europe. Here, in a
</p>
<p>broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy City merchants, we
</p>
<p>found the sculpture works for which we searched. Outside was a
</p>
<p>considerable yard full of monumental masonry. Inside was a large
</p>
<p>room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding. The
</p>
<p>manager, a big blond German, received us civilly and gave a clear
</p>
<p>answer to all Holmes’s questions. A reference to his books showed
</p>
<p>that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of
</p>
<p>Devine’s head of Napoleon, but that the three which had been sent
</p>
<p>to Morse Hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of
</p>
<p>six, the other three being sent to Harding Brothers, of
</p>
<p>Kensington. There was no reason why those six should be different
</p>
<p>from any of the other casts. He could suggest no possible cause
</p>
<p>why anyone should wish to destroy them—in fact, he laughed at the
</p>
<p>idea. Their wholesale price was six shillings, but the retailer
</p>
<p>would get twelve or more. The cast was taken in two moulds from
</p>
<p>each side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of
</p>
<p>Paris were joined together to make the complete bust. The work
</p>
<p>was usually done by Italians, in the room we were in. When
</p>
<p>finished, the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry,
</p>
<p>and afterwards stored. That was all he could tell us.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon
</p>
<p>the manager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows knotted
</p>
<p>over his blue Teutonic eyes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Ah, the rascal!” he cried. “Yes, indeed, I know him very well.
</p>
<p>This has always been a respectable establishment, and the only
</p>
<p>time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very
</p>
<p>fellow. It was more than a year ago now. He knifed another
</p>
<p>Italian in the street, and then he came to the works with the
</p>
<p>police on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo was his
</p>
<p>name—his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engaging a
</p>
<p>man with such a face. But he was a good workman—one of the best.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“What did he get?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he is
</p>
<p>out now, but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have a
</p>
<p>cousin of his here, and I daresay he could tell you where he is.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“No, no,” cried Holmes, “not a word to the cousin—not a word, I
</p>
<p>beg of you. The matter is very important, and the farther I go
</p>
<p>with it, the more important it seems to grow. When you referred
</p>
<p>in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that the
</p>
<p>date was June 3rd of last year. Could you give me the date when
</p>
<p>Beppo was arrested?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,” the manager answered.
</p>
<p>“Yes,” he continued, after some turning over of pages, “he was
</p>
<p>paid last on May 20th.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Holmes. “I don’t think that I need intrude upon
</p>
<p>your time and patience any more.” With a last word of caution
</p>
<p>that he should say nothing as to our researches, we turned our
</p>
<p>faces westward once more.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a
</p>
<p>hasty luncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance
</p>
<p>announced “Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,” and the
</p>
<p>contents of the paper showed that Mr. Horace Harker had got his
</p>
<p>account into print after all. Two columns were occupied with a
</p>
<p>highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident.
</p>
<p>Holmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he
</p>
<p>ate. Once or twice he chuckled.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“This is all right, Watson,” said he. “Listen to this:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of
</p>
<p>opinion upon this case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the most
</p>
<p>experienced members of the official force, and Mr. Sherlock
</p>
<p>Holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have each come to the
</p>
<p>conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents, which have
</p>
<p>ended in so tragic a fashion, arise from lunacy rather than from
</p>
<p>deliberate crime. No explanation save mental aberration can cover
</p>
<p>the facts.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution, if you only
</p>
<p>know how to use it. And now, if you have quite finished, we will
</p>
<p>hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of Harding
</p>
<p>Brothers has to say on the matter.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp
</p>
<p>little person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a
</p>
<p>ready tongue.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening papers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Horace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied him with the
</p>
<p>bust some months ago. We ordered three busts of that sort from
</p>
<p>Gelder & Co., of Stepney. They are all sold now. To whom? Oh, I
</p>
<p>daresay by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell
</p>
<p>you. Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr. Harker you see,
</p>
<p>and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum Lodge, Laburnum Vale,
</p>
<p>Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of Lower Grove Road, Reading.
</p>
<p>No, I have never seen this face which you show me in the
</p>
<p>photograph. You would hardly forget it, would you, sir, for I’ve
</p>
<p>seldom seen an uglier. Have we any Italians on the staff? Yes,
</p>
<p>sir, we have several among our workpeople and cleaners. I daresay
</p>
<p>they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to. There
</p>
<p>is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. Well,
</p>
<p>well, it’s a very strange business, and I hope that you will let
</p>
<p>me know if anything comes of your inquiries.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding’s evidence, and
</p>
<p>I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which
</p>
<p>affairs were taking. He made no remark, however, save that,
</p>
<p>unless we hurried, we should be late for our appointment with
</p>
<p>Lestrade. Sure enough, when we reached Baker Street the detective
</p>
<p>was already there, and we found him pacing up and down in a fever
</p>
<p>of impatience. His look of importance showed that his day’s work
</p>
<p>had not been in vain.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well?” he asked. “What luck, Mr. Holmes?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted one,” my
</p>
<p>friend explained. “We have seen both the retailers and also the
</p>
<p>wholesale manufacturers. I can trace each of the busts now from
</p>
<p>the beginning.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The busts,” cried Lestrade. “Well, well, you have your own
</p>
<p>methods, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a word
</p>
<p>against them, but I think I have done a better day’s work than
</p>
<p>you. I have identified the dead man.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“You don’t say so?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“And found a cause for the crime.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Splendid!”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and
</p>
<p>the Italian Quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem
</p>
<p>round his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he
</p>
<p>was from the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught
</p>
<p>sight of him. His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is
</p>
<p>one of the greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with
</p>
<p>the Mafia, which, as you know, is a secret political society,
</p>
<p>enforcing its decrees by murder. Now, you see how the affair
</p>
<p>begins to clear up. The other fellow is probably an Italian also,
</p>
<p>and a member of the Mafia. He has broken the rules in some
</p>
<p>fashion. Pietro is set upon his track. Probably the photograph we
</p>
<p>found in his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not knife
</p>
<p>the wrong person. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house,
</p>
<p>he waits outside for him, and in the scuffle he receives his own
</p>
<p>death-wound. How is that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!” he cried. “But I didn’t quite
</p>
<p>follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After
</p>
<p>all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It
</p>
<p>is the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you
</p>
<p>that I am gathering all the threads into my hands.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“And the next stage?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian
</p>
<p>Quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest
</p>
<p>him on the charge of murder. Will you come with us?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I
</p>
<p>can’t say for certain, because it all depends—well, it all
</p>
<p>depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control.
</p>
<p>But I have great hopes—in fact, the betting is exactly two to
</p>
<p>one—that if you will come with us to-night I shall be able to
</p>
<p>help you to lay him by the heels.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“In the Italian Quarter?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“No, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find
</p>
<p>him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade,
</p>
<p>I’ll promise to go to the Italian Quarter with you to-morrow, and
</p>
<p>no harm will be done by the delay. And now I think that a few
</p>
<p>hours’ sleep would do us all good, for I do not propose to leave
</p>
<p>before eleven o’clock, and it is unlikely that we shall be back
</p>
<p>before morning. You’ll dine with us, Lestrade, and then you are
</p>
<p>welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In the
</p>
<p>meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an
</p>
<p>express messenger, for I have a letter to send and it is
</p>
<p>important that it should go at once.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old
</p>
<p>daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When
</p>
<p>at last he descended, it was with triumph in his eyes, but he
</p>
<p>said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches.
</p>
<p>For my own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which
</p>
<p>he had traced the various windings of this complex case, and,
</p>
<p>though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I
</p>
<p>understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal
</p>
<p>to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one of which, I
</p>
<p>remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object of our journey
</p>
<p>was to catch him in the very act, and I could not but admire the
</p>
<p>cunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the
</p>
<p>evening paper, so as to give the fellow the idea that he could
</p>
<p>continue his scheme with impunity. I was not surprised when
</p>
<p>Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with me. He had
</p>
<p>himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop, which was his
</p>
<p>favourite weapon.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a
</p>
<p>spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was
</p>
<p>directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road
</p>
<p>fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds.
</p>
<p>In the light of a street lamp we read “Laburnum Villa” upon the
</p>
<p>gate-post of one of them. The occupants had evidently retired to
</p>
<p>rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door,
</p>
<p>which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path. The
</p>
<p>wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a
</p>
<p>dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was that we
</p>
<p>crouched.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I fear that you’ll have a long wait,” Holmes whispered. “We may
</p>
<p>thank our stars that it is not raining. I don’t think we can even
</p>
<p>venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it’s a two to one
</p>
<p>chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as
</p>
<p>Holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and
</p>
<p>singular fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn
</p>
<p>us of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark
</p>
<p>figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path.
</p>
<p>We saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and
</p>
<p>disappear against the black shadow of the house. There was a long
</p>
<p>pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very gentle
</p>
<p>creaking sound came to our ears. The window was being opened. The
</p>
<p>noise ceased, and again there was a long silence. The fellow was
</p>
<p>making his way into the house. We saw the sudden flash of a dark
</p>
<p>lantern inside the room. What he sought was evidently not there,
</p>
<p>for again we saw the flash through another blind, and then
</p>
<p>through another.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs
</p>
<p>out,” Lestrade whispered.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But before we could move, the man had emerged again. As he came
</p>
<p>out into the glimmering patch of light, we saw that he carried
</p>
<p>something white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round
</p>
<p>him. The silence of the deserted street reassured him. Turning
</p>
<p>his back upon us he laid down his burden, and the next instant
</p>
<p>there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter and
</p>
<p>rattle. The man was so intent upon what he was doing that he
</p>
<p>never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. With the
</p>
<p>bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later
</p>
<p>Lestrade and I had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had
</p>
<p>been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow
</p>
<p>face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at us, and I
</p>
<p>knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had
</p>
<p>secured.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his
</p>
<p>attention. Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most
</p>
<p>carefully examining that which the man had brought from the
</p>
<p>house. It was a bust of Napoleon, like the one which we had seen
</p>
<p>that morning, and it had been broken into similar fragments.
</p>
<p>Carefully Holmes held each separate shard to the light, but in no
</p>
<p>way did it differ from any other shattered piece of plaster. He
</p>
<p>had just completed his examination when the hall lights flew up,
</p>
<p>the door opened, and the owner of the house, a jovial, rotund
</p>
<p>figure in shirt and trousers, presented himself.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?” said Holmes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the
</p>
<p>note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly
</p>
<p>what you told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited
</p>
<p>developments. Well, I’m very glad to see that you have got the
</p>
<p>rascal. I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and have some
</p>
<p>refreshment.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters,
</p>
<p>so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all
</p>
<p>four upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say,
</p>
<p>but he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once,
</p>
<p>when my hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a
</p>
<p>hungry wolf. We stayed long enough at the police-station to learn
</p>
<p>that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few
</p>
<p>shillings and a long sheath knife, the handle of which bore
</p>
<p>copious traces of recent blood.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” said Lestrade, as we parted. “Hill knows all
</p>
<p>these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You’ll find that my
</p>
<p>theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I’m sure I am
</p>
<p>exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way
</p>
<p>in which you laid hands upon him. I don’t quite understand it all
</p>
<p>yet.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,” said
</p>
<p>Holmes. “Besides, there are one or two details which are not
</p>
<p>finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth
</p>
<p>working out to the very end. If you will come round once more to
</p>
<p>my rooms at six o’clock to-morrow, I think I shall be able to
</p>
<p>show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of
</p>
<p>this business, which presents some features which make it
</p>
<p>absolutely original in the history of crime. If ever I permit you
</p>
<p>to chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee
</p>
<p>that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular
</p>
<p>adventure of the Napoleonic busts.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with much
</p>
<p>information concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was
</p>
<p>Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-known ne’er-do-well
</p>
<p>among the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and
</p>
<p>had earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and
</p>
<p>had twice already been in jail—once for a petty theft, and once,
</p>
<p>as we had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. He
</p>
<p>could talk English perfectly well. His reasons for destroying the
</p>
<p>busts were still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions
</p>
<p>upon the subject, but the police had discovered that these same
</p>
<p>busts might very well have been made by his own hands, since he
</p>
<p>was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of Gelder
</p>
<p>& Co. To all this information, much of which we already knew,
</p>
<p>Holmes listened with polite attention, but I, who knew him so
</p>
<p>well, could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I
</p>
<p>detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath
</p>
<p>that mask which he was wont to assume. At last he started in his
</p>
<p>chair, and his eyes brightened. There had been a ring at the
</p>
<p>bell. A minute later we heard steps upon the stairs, and an
</p>
<p>elderly red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in.
</p>
<p>In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which
</p>
<p>he placed upon the table.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My friend bowed and smiled. “Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I
</p>
<p>suppose?” said he.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains were
</p>
<p>awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Exactly.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I have your letter here. You said, ‘I desire to possess a copy
</p>
<p>of Devine’s Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for
</p>
<p>the one which is in your possession.’ Is that right?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Certainly.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not
</p>
<p>imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is
</p>
<p>very simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had
</p>
<p>sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“No, he did not.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only
</p>
<p>gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to
</p>
<p>know that before I take ten pounds from you.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have
</p>
<p>named that price, so I intend to stick to it.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust
</p>
<p>up with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!” He opened his
</p>
<p>bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen
</p>
<p>of that bust which we had already seen more than once in
</p>
<p>fragments.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note
</p>
<p>upon the table.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence
</p>
<p>of these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every
</p>
<p>possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a
</p>
<p>methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events
</p>
<p>might take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your
</p>
<p>money, and I wish you a very good evening.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmes’s movements
</p>
<p>were such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean
</p>
<p>white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he
</p>
<p>placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth.
</p>
<p>Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a
</p>
<p>sharp blow on the top of the head. The figure broke into
</p>
<p>fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains.
</p>
<p>Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one
</p>
<p>splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in
</p>
<p>a pudding.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Gentlemen,” he cried, “let me introduce you to the famous black
</p>
<p>pearl of the Borgias.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a
</p>
<p>spontaneous impulse, we both broke at clapping, as at the
</p>
<p>well-wrought crisis of a play. A flush of colour sprang to
</p>
<p>Holmes’s pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master
</p>
<p>dramatist who receives the homage of his audience. It was at such
</p>
<p>moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine,
</p>
<p>and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause. The same
</p>
<p>singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with
</p>
<p>disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its
</p>
<p>depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Yes, gentlemen,” said he, “it is the most famous pearl now
</p>
<p>existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a
</p>
<p>connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the
</p>
<p>Prince of Colonna’s bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was
</p>
<p>lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of
</p>
<p>Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You
</p>
<p>will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the
</p>
<p>disappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the
</p>
<p>London police to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the
</p>
<p>case, but I was unable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell
</p>
<p>upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was
</p>
<p>proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to trace
</p>
<p>any connection between them. The maid’s name was Lucretia
</p>
<p>Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who
</p>
<p>was murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking
</p>
<p>up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the
</p>
<p>disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest
</p>
<p>of Beppo, for some crime of violence—an event which took place in
</p>
<p>the factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts
</p>
<p>were being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events,
</p>
<p>though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way
</p>
<p>in which they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in
</p>
<p>his possession. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have
</p>
<p>been Pietro’s confederate, he may have been the go-between of
</p>
<p>Pietro and his sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the
</p>
<p>correct solution.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“The main fact is that he _had_ the pearl, and at that moment,
</p>
<p>when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made
</p>
<p>for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only
</p>
<p>a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize,
</p>
<p>which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six
</p>
<p>plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them
</p>
<p>was still soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a
</p>
<p>small hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a
</p>
<p>few touches covered over the aperture once more. It was an
</p>
<p>admirable hiding-place. No one could possibly find it. But Beppo
</p>
<p>was condemned to a year’s imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his
</p>
<p>six busts were scattered over London. He could not tell which
</p>
<p>contained his treasure. Only by breaking them could he see. Even
</p>
<p>shaking would tell him nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was
</p>
<p>probable that the pearl would adhere to it—as, in fact, it has
</p>
<p>done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted his search with
</p>
<p>considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a cousin who
</p>
<p>works with Gelder, he found out the retail firms who had bought
</p>
<p>the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson, and
</p>
<p>in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there.
</p>
<p>Then, with the help of some Italian employee, he succeeded in
</p>
<p>finding out where the other three busts had gone. The first was
</p>
<p>at Harker’s. There he was dogged by his confederate, who held
</p>
<p>Beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him
</p>
<p>in the scuffle which followed.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?”
</p>
<p>I asked.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“As a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him
</p>
<p>from any third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after
</p>
<p>the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather
</p>
<p>than delay his movements. He would fear that the police would
</p>
<p>read his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get
</p>
<p>ahead of him. Of course, I could not say that he had not found
</p>
<p>the pearl in Harker’s bust. I had not even concluded for certain
</p>
<p>that it was the pearl, but it was evident to me that he was
</p>
<p>looking for something, since he carried the bust past the other
</p>
<p>houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp
</p>
<p>overlooking it. Since Harker’s bust was one in three, the chances
</p>
<p>were exactly as I told you—two to one against the pearl being
</p>
<p>inside it. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he
</p>
<p>would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the
</p>
<p>house, so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with
</p>
<p>the happiest results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain
</p>
<p>that it was the Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the
</p>
<p>murdered man linked the one event with the other. There only
</p>
<p>remained a single bust—the Reading one—and the pearl must be
</p>
<p>there. I bought it in your presence from the owner—and there it
</p>
<p>lies.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We sat in silence for a moment.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Well,” said Lestrade, “I’ve seen you handle a good many cases,
</p>
<p>Mr. Holmes, but I don’t know that I ever knew a more workmanlike
</p>
<p>one than that. We’re not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No,
</p>
<p>sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow,
</p>
<p>there’s not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest
</p>
<p>constable, who wouldn’t be glad to shake you by the hand.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Thank you!” said Holmes. “Thank you!” and as he turned away, it
</p>
<p>seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human
</p>
<p>emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold
</p>
<p>and practical thinker once more. “Put the pearl in the safe,
</p>
<p>Watson,” said he, “and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton
</p>
<p>forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes
</p>
<p>your way, I shall be happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two
</p>
<p>as to its solution.”</p>
